>> Object oriented.	                                             >> Structure oriented.

>> Program is divided into objects.	                              >> Program is divided into functions.

>> Bottom-up approach.	                                          >> Top-down approach.

>> Inheritance property is used.	                                 >> Inheritance is not allowed.

>> It uses access specifier.	                                    >> It doesnâ€™t use access specifier.

>> Encapsulation is used to hide the data.             	         >> No data hiding.

>> Concept of virtual function.	                                 >> No virtual function.

>> Object functions are linked                                    >> Parts of program are linked through
   through message passing.                                          parameter passing.

>> Adding new data and functions             	                  >> Expanding new data and functions is 
   is easy.                                                          not easy.

>> The existing code can be reused.	                              >> No code reusability.

>> use for solving big problems.	                                 >> Not suitable for solving big problems.

>> C++, Java.                                              	      >> C, Pascal.
